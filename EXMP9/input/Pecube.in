Simple Pecube test
Uniform exhumation rate at 1 km/Myr
through a flat topography
The main purpose is to compare predicted FT length distributions
produced by Peter van der Beek routine (FT_code_flag = 0)
or Richard Ketcham routine (FT_lemgth = 1)
For this we use a "fake" data file that only contain one sample with a location (LAT LON) only

echo_input_file = 1

nx = 21
ny = 21

ntime = 1
time_topo1 = 10
output1 = 0

nfault = 1
npoint1 = -1

nstep1 = 1
time_start1_1 = 20
time_end1_1 = 0
velo1_1 = 1

!FT_code_flag = 1

data_folder = TEST
